Now to move towards Backend Engineer level (1–2 years experience), you must focus on:
	•	Aggregations
	•	Calculations
	•	Reporting logic
	•	Analytics queries
	•	Optimized SQLAlchemy queries
	•	Business rules

these things i have to add into it 
	•	How many books a student issued
	•	How many returned late
	•	How many returned on time
	•	Total fine paid
	•	Average delay days
	•	Most active student
	•	Most issued book
	•	Monthly fine report
	•	Top defaulters

This is called Analytics Layer.
